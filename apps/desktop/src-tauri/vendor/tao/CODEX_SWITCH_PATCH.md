This is Tao 0.35.3 from crates.io, licensed under Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE`).
Original crate checksum: `d1c93047acf68669466a34690ac58cca7010bd1b201e1ec86f1fd0a75d3dd4a9`.

Backported upstream fix:
[tauri-apps/tao#1215](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/pull/1215),
commit [`c704261c519c58cfdd0bc2d58ba24e06a0b71c92`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/commit/c704261c519c58cfdd0bc2d58ba24e06a0b71c92).
The application currently uses tauri-runtime-wry's Tao `^0.35.0` dependency;
the fix was not published in that compatible release series.

Two dumps of RemoteAI 1.7.43 on Windows 10, taken over 14 minutes apart,
showed the UI thread handling Shift `WM_KEYUP` while holding
`KEY_EVENT_BUILDERS`. Its call to `PeekMessageW` dispatched a sent
`WM_KILLFOCUS`, recursively entering the same window procedure and waiting
forever for that mutex. Keyboard layout and IME window-state locks had the
same risk. A keyboard-only message filter does not prevent dispatch of sent
nonqueued focus messages.

The backport changes only four Windows source files:

- `event_loop.rs`: peek before locking keyboard/IME state; pass the snapshot
  into the input handlers.
- `keyboard.rs`: consume that snapshot, read key state before acquiring the
  layout-cache lock, and shorten layout lock scopes.
- `keyboard_layout.rs`: expose the upstream modifier helper.
- `minimal_ime.rs`: consume the character-lookahead snapshot without pumping
  messages while window state is locked.

The only additional source change is a safety comment for the moved Win32 call.
Library sources, README, and licenses are otherwise preserved. The normalized
Cargo manifest omits unused examples and their development dependencies.
The upstream formatting configuration is included without its nightly-only
import grouping option so the vendored source can be checked with stable rustfmt.

`../../tests/windows_input_reentrancy.rs` exercises real hidden Tao windows
using the exact dependency selected by the application. A second thread queues
`WM_KILLFOCUS` during key-down/up and character handling. A thread-local
`WH_GETMESSAGE` hook also queues it between keyboard and IME lookahead to test
the separate IME lock. Assertions require actual nested delivery, successful
completion, and intact key/text events (including UTF-16 surrogate pairs and
Chinese IME text). Each scenario runs in a child process with a 20-second
deadline so a regression fails instead of hanging the test runner.
As negative controls, the same fixture with unmodified Tao 0.35.3 reproduced
both the Shift-release deadlock and the separate IME reentry deadlock.
All eight patched scenarios also passed on the affected Windows 10 18363 VM
inside its RDP session, using an isolated fixture executable; the installed
RemoteAI process was not replaced or restarted for that check.

Run from the repository root on Windows:

```powershell
cargo test --locked --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test windows_input_reentrancy
```

This integration target also runs in the existing desktop Rust checks and
release CI, including nextest. Remove this patch when Tauri accepts a released
Tao version containing the fix and that version passes the same regression
tests. Do not replace the mutex with a reentrant mutex or skip input events;
neither addresses all shared state protected across message pumping.
